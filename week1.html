            <h1>Human-Powered-Machine</h1>
            <p>Design and build a human-powered machine that performs a practical function without using electricity.
            </p>
            <p>This could include lifting a small weight, pumping water, grinding grain,or transporting an object.</p>
            <p>Your machine should demonstrate principles of mechanical advantage, energy efficiency, and user-centered
                design.</p>
            <p>This challenge blends physics with creativity and problem-solving. The goal is not just to make
                something that
                <br> works but something that works well, is intuitive to use, and reflects thoughtful
                design.<br><br><b>Requirements</b>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The machine must be entirely powered by human effort (e.g., pushing, pulling, turning).</li>
                <li>Must perform a useful task (e.g., lift, move, rotate, grind, compress).</li>
                <li>Use simple machines (e.g., levers, pulleys, gears, screws, wheels, inclined planes).</li>
                <li>Prioritize safety, durability, and ease of use.</li>
                <li>Maximize mechanical advantage and minimize wasted effort.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="pulley">
            <h1>Pulley</h1>
            <p>This machine helps to fetch water from the well using several principles, such as mechanical
                advantage.</p>
            <b>Here are the principles:</b> <br>
            <p>Mechanical advantage is the ratio of the output to the input. It allows a smaller input force to lift a
                heavier load.</p>
            <p>The pulley uses mechanical advantage in fetching the water from the well.</p>
            <p> Force Distributionâ€”A pulley changes the direction of the applied force. Pulling down on a rope can lift
                an object upward.</p>
            <p>The pulley uses force distribution to pull the container holding the water to the top.</p>
            <p> Work and energy - The work input must equal the work output in an ideal pulley.</p>
            <p>The pulley utilizes these principles to efficiently fetch water from the well.
            </p>
            <h2>Reflections on energy efficiency and user-centered design</h2>
            <p>The efficiency is reduced due to friction in the pulley due to the design, which is user-friendly.</p>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>The machine was able to pull the water, however, the machine could not support itself,<br> and improving
                the
                design would make the machine more efficient.</p>

            <p>*She babysitted for 48 hours</p>
            <p>In 1 hour she earns 12 GHS, what about 48 hours. </p>
            <p>48 * 12 = 576 GHS</p>
            <h2>How much do you pay your brother and his wife?</h2>
            <p>10/100 * 576 = 57.6 GHS</p>
            <h2>How much do you keep?</h2>
            <P>576 - 57.6 = 518.4 GHS</P>
