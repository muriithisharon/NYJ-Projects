    <p><h2>Pulley </h2><br>
This machine helps to fetch water from the well using several principles, such as mechanical advantage.

Here are the principles:
Mechanical advantage is the ratio of the output to the input. It allows a smaller input force to lift a heavier load. The pulley uses mechanical advantage in fetching the water from the well.
Force Distributionâ€”A pulley changes the direction of the applied force. Pulling down on a rope can lift an object upward. The pulley uses force distribution to pull the container holding the water to the top.
Work and energy - The work input must equal the work output in an ideal pulley.
The pulley utilizes these principles to efficiently fetch water from the well.
