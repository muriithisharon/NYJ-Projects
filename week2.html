            <h2>Rulebook</h2>
            <h3>Game Components</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Trait cardboards each displaying traits of an animal.</li>
                <li>Animal cards, each with a single animal name written.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Match trait boards with their correct animal cards.<br>
                    Each correct match earns you a point. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Setup</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Shuffle all animal cards and place them in a face-down draw pile.</li>
                <li>Place the board at the middle where everyone can access and see every trait clearly.</li>
                <li>Decide who goes first by rolling a die.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How to Play</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>On your turn, draw the top card from the animal pile and read it aloud.</li>
                <li>Look at the trait boards on the table and decide which trait matches the drawn animal.</li>
                <li>If you think you know, announce your choice and place the animal card on that trait board.</li>
                <li>If you are correct, you earn 1 point.</li>
                <li>If you are incorrect, the card is returned to the bottom of the trait pile and your turn ends.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Example Turn</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Player draws an animal card (e.g., Chameleon).</li>
                <li>Player looks at the trait boards and selects "camouflages".</li>
                <li>If "camouflages" is a board on the table and it is correct, the player earns 1 point and keeps the animal card.</li>
                <li>If the player chooses incorrectly, the animal card is returned, and the next player takes their turn.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Scoring</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Each correct match earns you 1 point.</li>
                <li>Keep track of your points with score tokens.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Winning the Game</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The game ends when all animal cards have been correctly matched to trait boards.</li>
                <li>The player with the most points at the end is the winner.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Contrast</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All players race to match animal cards to trait boards at the same time. The first correct match wins the point.</li>
                <li>Some trait cards may match more than one animal; players must explain their reasoning for the match to get the point.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Science Communication Reflection (Summary)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Goal:</strong> Make learning about animal traits and adaptations fun and easy for everyone.</li>
                <li><strong>Biological Concepts:</strong> Teach about animal diversity, adaptation, and how traits help animals survive.</li>
                <li><strong>Simplification:</strong> Used common animals and simple language for traits and rules.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Added rules for explaining answers and made trait wording easier after playtesting.</li>
                <li><strong>Lesson Learned:</strong> Science communication is best when it is simple, visual, and interactive.</li>

            <h2>Science Communication Reflection</h2>
            <h3>Designing the Animal Traits Card Game</h3>
            <p>
                When we were creating the Animal Traits Card Game, we wanted to make learning about animals and their special features fun and easy for everyone. In this reflection, We will explain the choices we made during the design process, the biological ideas we wanted to teach, how we made them simple, and how feedback from playtesting helped us improve the game.
            </p>
            <h4>What biological concepts did we want to teach?</h4>
            <p>
                The main idea behind the game was to help players learn about animal diversity and adaptation. We wanted to show that animals have different traits which help them survive in their environments. By matching these traits to the correct animals, players could learn how living things are adapted to where they live and what they do. We also wanted to teach that some traits are shared by many animals, while others are unique.
            </p>
            <h4>How did we represent these ideas?</h4>
            <p>
                To make these biology ideas easy to understand, we chose common and easily recognizable animals like elephants, giraffes and octopus. We avoided using rare or very complicated animals so that players would not get confused. For the traits, we used simple language. Instead of scientific words, we wrote things like "long beak" or "nesting skills" instead of cognition. We wanted the trait boards to be quick to read and understand, even for young children.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rulebook was written in clear, step-by-step instructions, with examples to make sure everyone could understand how to play. We included suggestions for how to help younger players or make the game more challenging for older ones.
            </p>
            <h4>What feedback did we get from playtesting, and how did we respond?</h4>
            <p>
                When we first tested the game with friends, we learned a lot from watching how they played and listening to their comments. Some players got confused when a trait could match more than one animal. To help with this, we added a rule that allowed players to explain why they chose a certain animal, and as long as their explanation made sense, they could get the point. This made the game more about thinking and discussing, not just memorizing answers.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some people found a few traits too hard to understand, so we changed difficult words into simpler ones.
            </p>
            <h4>Conclusion</h4>
            <p>
                Designing this game taught us that science communication works best when it is simple, visual, and interactive. By listening to feedback and making changes, we were able to help players enjoy learning about animal biology in a way that was fun and easy to understand.
